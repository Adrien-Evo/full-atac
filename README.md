# GEOpyflow-ChIPseq
a snakemake pipeline to process ChIP-seq files from GEO

I have so many people asking me to process a public GEO ChIP-seq data set for them. I hate to repeat the same steps and decide to make a pipeline for it.

switch to a different brach to see the codes. now I have `shark` branch for the LSF system.
