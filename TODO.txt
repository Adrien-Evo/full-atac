Rules that can be added from the fulle-atac pipe :
adapter_trimming
scaling factors


Rules that need to be changed or reworked :
down_sample : downsampling is just plain bad
peak calling with MACS1 : no need for MACS1 really

rules than can prob be removed :
flagstat_bam


Adding work to the multiQC : ENCODE metrics need to be added
